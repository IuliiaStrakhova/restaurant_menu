It is a final project after studying short HTML course on codedex.io. Here I work only with HTML and use some styling with <style>.
A <title> element with the restaurant name is included in the <head> element.

A header section features:
1) An image with an id of "header-img".
2) A heading h1 element with the name of the restaurant.
3) A navigation section with two headings for "#menu" and "#order-form".

A main section for the menu and order form features:

Two sections, each with a h2 heading that says "Menu" and "Place Your Order".

1)The "Menu" section have at three "article" elements for the menu items that use the following elements:
1. An img image element.
2. A h3 element for the name of the menu item.
3. A "p" paragraph element that briefly describes the item (1-2 sentences) and includes price information (italicized).

2)The "Place Your Order" section include a "form" element with the following inputs:
- Number inputs for each menu item (validate input with a minimum of 0).
- Radio and/or checkbox inputs for things like sides and add-ons.
- One "textarea" element for one of the items (for special requests).
- A submit input that says "Go To Checkout".

A footer that includes a "p" paragraph element that reads "Made with love by " followed by my Cod√©dex username.
